## Kanban Board

***Switch to browser view***
***Switch to Tetra Kanban Board tab***

- Managing tasks you need to complete
- Developed by industrial engineer @ Toyota, 1950s
- They work by allowing you to visualize progress in a project and the state of individual components of a project
- Individual components = cards
- Progression = lists/columns

- Here's one I'm using
- Backlog
  - Make a card
- WIP
- Blocked
- Review
  - Good place to include a mentor in the discussion
- Closed

- This was with GitHub
  - You can customize the cards
  - Very powerful, steep learning curve
  - Free!
- You can also use Trello
  - Some customizations
  - Due dates
  - Merely a free tier
  - Brainstorming template


## General Communication Channel

***Switch to face view***

- Very important to have a place where people can talk asynchronously
- Students likely are already aware of most options

- Discord
  - My favorite
  - Many text chats
  - Voice/video chats
  - Free!
- Slack
  - Similar to Discord
  - No voice chat
  - Threads
  - 10,000 message limit
- Zoom
  - Familiar from school
  - Voice chat
  - limited text chat
  - 45 minute limit to free tier
- Instant messaging
  - E.g. GroupMe, WhatsApp, SMS, etc
  - Free
  - Notifications are annoying

- Persistant communication
  - Google Docs
  - Handy for keeping documentation


## Meetings

- LAME
  - Well yes, but actually no
- 4 kinds of meetings
  - Planning
    - Every 2 weeks
    - What are we doing for the next 2 weeks?
    - Perhaps on Mondays/Tuesdays
  - Retrospective
    - Weeks without Planning meetings
    - How did the last 2-week sprint go?
    - Perhaps on Thursdays/Fridays
  - Tag Up
    - 1-2 times per week
    - SHORT
    - What have I been doing
    - What will I be doing
    - What am I blocking on
    - NO DISCUSSION
  - Social Hour
    - No robot talk
    - Get to know your teammates

- Communicate with eachother meeting importance
  - Not everyone can make every meeting
  - Tier which meetings are most important, e.g.
    - Planning
    - Retro
    - Tag Up
    - Social Hour


## Build Days

- How do you do builds + COVID???

### Planning

- Doing weekly builds where you just wing it doesn't respect COVID restrictions
- CAD before build is an absolute must
- Students have access to free CAD!

***Switch to Onshape Tab***
- Onshape
  - Free for non-commercial use
  - "Google Drive of CAD"
  - Forums
  - Reasonable on low-end PCs
  - Linux/macOS/Windows
***Switch to SolidWorks view***
- SolidWorks
  - Free for FIRST students
  - Very common, NASA
  - SolidWorks Reddit
  - Slow on low-power computers
  - Windows
***Switch to face view***
- Fusion360
  - Free student tier, full functionality
  - Using it for Tetra
  - Runs on low-power computers
  - macOS/Windows
- PTC Creo
  - Free student tier
  - Used by Blue Origin
  - Windows

- I recommend OnShape, but you'll do well with any CAD software

- Prior to a build, you need
  - List of everything you're going to make
  - Parts to put everything together
    - A BOM is critical for this
  - Tools to connect all the parts
  - Instructions for how to build everything
    - Pretty hard, ideally have the designers present too
  - During design, use part kits to save part-getting hassle, e.g.
    - goBuilda
    - REV
    - Actobotics
    - Tetrix

### Logistics

- Where will the build be held?
  - School if they'll let you
    - Present them your build plan
      - COVID plan
        - Masks
        - 6' social distancing
      - Detailed schedule of everything you're building
        - LEGO
  - Teammate's well-ventilated garage
  - Teammate's back yard with card tables
    - Weather

### Execution

- #1 thing is respect COVID
- Make sure time, date, and location are well communicated
  - Send out reminders
    - 1 week
    - 1 day
  - Make sure the parts and tools are coming

- Don't make showing to builds a matter dedication to the team
  - COVID is scary

- Where does the robot go between builds
  - If you can work at the school, then the school might be good
  - A team member's house is also a good option
    - Perhaps the person who hosts builds?


## Software and Testing

- Get the robot done 1 month ahead of competition
- Hand it off to someone that can run the software
- Give them free rein to test


- Thanks for listening
- Think critically about what I've said
- Contact me if you you come up with interesting stuff
- Questions
