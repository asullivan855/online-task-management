# Online Task Management

I wrote this talk for the 2020 Los Angeles FIRST Tech Challenge Kickoff event on 13 September 2020.  It talks about how to build a robot with a distributed team based on my (ongoing) experience building a ventilator splitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.  You can find the lecture document [here](OnlineTaskManagement.md) and my speaker notes [here](OnlineTaskManagementSpeakerNotes.md).

There'll also be a video of live presentation available after the event.
